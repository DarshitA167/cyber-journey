# Cyber Journey

This repository documents a structured, long-term progression into cybersecurity.

It is not a collection of notes or random lab solutions.
It is a planned roadmap followed step-by-step, where each entry represents practical work completed on controlled training platforms.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a public, verifiable record of consistent hands-on practice and evolving technical understanding.

## What this repository contains

Inside this project you will find three types of material:

1. Practical exploitation exercises
2. Conceptual understanding recorded in plain language
3. Evidence of completed work

The README intentionally does **not** contain technical explanations.
All technical reasoning lives inside the individual writeups.

## Roadmap

This project follows a staged progression rather than random learning.

### Phase 1 — Foundations

Goal: Understand how web applications communicate and process user input.

Focus:

* HTTP requests
* Request/response flow
* Burp Suite interception
* Basic authentication logic

---

### Phase 2 — Input Manipulation

Goal: Learn how application logic changes when input is modified.

Focus:

* SQL Injection
* Authentication bypass
* Data retrieval vulnerabilities
* Server-side trust assumptions

---

### Phase 3 — Web Vulnerability Expansion

Goal: Move beyond one vulnerability type and understand client/server interaction deeper.

Focus:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Access control flaws
* Session behavior
* Application workflow analysis

---

### Phase 4 — Practical Testing Mindset

Goal: Stop solving guided labs and begin analyzing behavior independently.

Focus:

* Identifying attack surfaces
* Manual testing techniques
* Reading application responses
* Writing structured vulnerability reports

---

### Phase 5 — Independent Practice

Goal: Apply learned techniques outside guided labs.

Focus:

* Responsible disclosure programs
* Methodical testing
* Consistent documentation
* Building personal testing methodology

---

## How this repository is used

For each exercise:

* the lab is completed
* the behavior is analyzed
* the result is documented
* evidence is recorded

The objective is not speed.

The objective is repeatable understanding.

---

## Why this exists

Many people study cybersecurity passively.

This repository exists to ensure:

* accountability
* consistency
* measurable progress

By documenting every step publicly, progress becomes verifiable rather than claimed.

---

## Scope

All activities documented here are performed only on intentionally vulnerable training environments and legal educational platforms.

No unauthorized systems are targeted.

---

## Ongoing Work

This repository is continuously updated as the roadmap progresses.
