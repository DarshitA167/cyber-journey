# Day 0 — The Decision

Cybersecurity was not clear to me at first. It felt like a distant, mysterious field where “hackers” did complex magic behind screens.

But today I understood something fundamental:

Systems are not broken by power.
They are broken by logic.

Every application depends on trust.
Every database depends on input.
And every input is a possible instruction.

The moment I realized that a simple change in data could alter system behavior, I stopped seeing cybersecurity as a subject.

I started seeing it as control over logic.

This is not just about hacking websites.
It is about understanding how digital systems think — and where they fail.

Today is not the day I became a hacker.

Today is the day I decided to think like one.

From this point forward, I am not just studying cybersecurity — I am documenting a journey to understand how computers trust, and how that trust can be broken.
